Anchors assert the position of a string or the matching process. A Caret (^) helps us denote the beginning of a string or line and a Dollar ($) helps us denote the end.

## Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found.
